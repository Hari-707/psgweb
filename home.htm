<br><b><h3>A COLLEGE PAR EXCELLENCE</h3><b><br>
<p> We, at PSGCAS<br><br>

          The growth of PSG CAS has been phenomenal in the last 69 years. Spread over 61.4 acres of sprawling land, it is one of the foremost national &amp; global institutions of higher education, and has developed in a plethora of fields over the years. An army of human resource has passed through its portals. contributing as a vital and integral part of the country's developmental process. Its continuous achievements are highlighted here under:<br><br>
</p>
<h3><b>ACCOLADES</b></h3><br><br>
          <p>The step-by-step development of the college has brought in several laurels, To mention a few...<br><br>
          </p>
<h3><b>Autonomy</b></h3><br><br>
         <p> The strength of the institution has been its autonomous status for the last 40 years. It was one among the first five Arts &amp; Science colleges in the state to attain 'academic autonomy' in 1978, in the first phase itself.
<br><br></p>
<h3><b>National Accreditation</b></h3><br><br>

         <p>  The thirst for further achievements through self-introspection and external assessment initiated the college to opt for assessment and accreditation by NAAC, in 1999 itself.
           The strengths and limitations identified by the college through 'academic audit' were in consonance with that of the assessment team and it was identified to be a 'top college' with a 'Five Star' rating in 2000.
           In fact, the college has been rated highly by the UGC for the 'best practices' followed, in the September 2003 analysis of autonomous colleges.<br>

           This academic exercise has initiated tremendous developments in leaps and bounds, since 1999, thereby, placing it strategically on the national map.<br>

<br></p>
<h3><b>International Accreditation</b></h3><br><br>

            <p> With a quest towards 'quality education' from within and without, the college believed that academic excellence could be achieved only through proper systems. The only option towards this end was 'system audit' through the ISO Certification.<br>

             The recognition of the college with regard to its unique systems and design of curriculum was through the ISO 9001: 1994 Certification, from TUV Rheinland,Germany, in 2001, with the following scope:
             The college has established and applies a quality system for Design and Providing Educational Services Leading to Graduate~ Post Graduate &amp; Research Degrees in Arts, Management Science, Commerce &amp; Science. Design and Providing Vocational Training Programmes."<br>

              It is now upgraded to the ISO 9001:2000 Certification. This has brought in international fame and recognition resulting in the enrolment of 51 foreign students.<br>

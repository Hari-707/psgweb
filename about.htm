<br><br><br><br><br><br><h4><blockquote>"LET THERE BE CHARITY SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE MAY SHARE MY FAMILY'S PROSPERITY", said Sri. P.S.Govindasamy Naidu, the benevolent philanthropist, who believed firmly that 'Charity begins at home'. He daringly defined charity as "Service to society through development of education, industry and the needy and the poor".</blockquate>

<p><br><br><br>thus was born PSG College of Arts and Science in the year 1947 to the PSG &amp;Sons Charities Trust which was founded in the year 1926 by the four praise-worthy sons of P.S. Govindasamy Naidu, the four brothers of the PSG family, Thiru PSG Venkataswamy Naidu, Thiru PSG Rangaswamy Naidu, Thiru PSG Ganga Naidu and Thiru PSG Narayanaswamy Naidu who took "Charity through Education" with great missionary zeal.</p>

<p><br><br><br>"The Destiny of a Nation is decided in its classrooms" - PSG College of Arts and Science has proved this prophetic statement with conviction by emerging as on of the premier institutions of higher learning in this country.

The college has a team of experienced and efficient faculty and our academic programmes are challenging and updated. Thirty Nine Undergraduate and Twenty Four Postgraduate programmes are offered and may of them are unique. M.Phil and Ph.D programmes are offered in Nineteen faculties.</p>

<p><br><br><br>The college was identified as a College with Potential for Excellence by UGC in October 2004. It is one among 47 colleges in the country, 8 in the State and the only one in Bharathiar University.</p>

<p><br><br><br>The college has been accredited at the FIVE STAR level by NAAC and became an ISO 9001: 1994 certified institution in 2001 and subsequently an ISO 9001: 2000 certified institution since 2003.
